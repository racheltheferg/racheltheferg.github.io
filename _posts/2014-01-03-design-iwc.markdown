### 25 years is a big deal for any business, but when you're a local non-profit fair trade business it's a SUPER BIG DEAL.

In August 2013, Global Gifts, a fair trade shop with three locations throughout Indiana, celebrated their 25th Anniversary with a variety of events: craft demos, live music, and the day's biggest draw, a bag sale. The organization needed to spread the word, but on a shoestring budget (read: less than $2,500).

I designed a series of posters for the stores and to be spread throughout the community, bag stuffers to be used the month before the sale, and a postcard to be mailed to Global Gift's customer list.

This print collateral was part of an integrated marketing campaign (also designed and implemented by me) that included social media, PR, radio advertisements, and web announcements.
